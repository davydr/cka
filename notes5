### Notes on Kubernetes Version Upgrade (CKA Question)

#### Key Points:
1. **High Probability Question**:
   - Upgrading a Kubernetes cluster is a critical question in the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam.
   - Ensure familiarity with the process as versions in the exam may vary.

2. **Scenario**:
   - Upgrade the **control plane** and **worker node** from version `1.18` to `1.19`.
   - Drain both nodes before the upgrade.
   - Make nodes schedulable again after the upgrade.

---

### **Steps to Upgrade Kubernetes Cluster**

#### **Step 1: Drain the Node**
- Evict all pods from the node to prepare for the upgrade:
  ```bash
  kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
  ```
- Example:
  ```bash
  kubectl drain control-plane --ignore-daemonsets
  kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets
  ```

---

#### **Step 2: Upgrade the Control Plane**
1. **Update the Package Index**:
   ```bash
   apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install the Desired Version of `kubeadm`**:
   ```bash
   apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.19.0-00
   ```

3. **Verify Upgrade Plan**:
   ```bash
   kubeadm upgrade plan
   ```

4. **Apply the Upgrade**:
   ```bash
   kubeadm upgrade apply v1.19.0
   ```

5. **Upgrade `kubelet`**:
   - Install the required version:
     ```bash
     apt-get install -y kubelet=1.19.0-00
     ```
   - Restart the `kubelet` service:
     ```bash
     systemctl restart kubelet
     ```

6. **Uncordon the Control Plane**:
   ```bash
   kubectl uncordon control-plane
   ```

---

#### **Step 3: Upgrade the Worker Node**
1. **SSH into the Worker Node**:
   ```bash
   ssh node01
   ```

2. **Update the Package Index**:
   ```bash
   apt-get update
   ```

3. **Install the Desired Version of `kubeadm`**:
   ```bash
   apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.19.0-00
   ```

4. **Upgrade the Worker Node**:
   ```bash
   kubeadm upgrade node
   ```

5. **Upgrade `kubelet`**:
   - Install the required version:
     ```bash
     apt-get install -y kubelet=1.19.0-00
     ```
   - Restart the `kubelet` service:
     ```bash
     systemctl restart kubelet
     ```

6. **Exit the Worker Node**:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

7. **Uncordon the Worker Node**:
   ```bash
   kubectl uncordon node01
   ```

---

### **Commands Summary**
- **Drain Nodes**:
  ```bash
  kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
  ```

- **Install/Upgrade Packages**:
  ```bash
  apt-get update
  apt-get install -y kubeadm=<version> kubelet=<version>
  systemctl restart kubelet
  ```

- **Control Plane Upgrade**:
  ```bash
  kubeadm upgrade apply v<version>
  ```

- **Worker Node Upgrade**:
  ```bash
  kubeadm upgrade node
  ```

- **Uncordon Nodes**:
  ```bash
  kubectl uncordon <node-name>
  ```

---

### **Verification**
1. Check node statuses:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
2. Confirm all nodes are in the `Ready` state and upgraded to the desired version.

---

### **Best Practices**
- **Hands-On Practice**:
  - Install a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm` and practice upgrading it to a newer version.
- **Documentation**:
  - Refer to Kubernetes documentation for version-specific upgrade guides.
- **Cheat Sheet**:
  - Use a cheat sheet for quick access to commands during the exam.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- Master the Kubernetes cluster upgrade process, including draining and uncordoning nodes.
- Practice version upgrades to build confidence.
- This question carries significant weight in the CKA exam, so prioritize its preparation.
